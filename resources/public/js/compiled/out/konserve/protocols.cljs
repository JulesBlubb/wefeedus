(defprotocol IEDNAsyncKeyValueStore
  "Allows to access a store similar to hash-map in EDN."
  (-get-in [this key-vec] "Returns the value stored described by key-vec or nil if the path is not resolvable.")
  (-assoc-in [this key-vec value] "Associates the key-vec to the value, any missing collections for the key-vec (nested maps and vectors) are newly created.")

(defprotocol IJSONAsyncKeyValueStore
  "SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Low-Level JSON implementation to give native performance. Might be merged into EDN later, when we find a comparable EDN solution. Assumes all values are JSON. Avoid using this protocol on the same store as an edn store."
  (-jget-in [this key-vec] "Returns the value stored described by key-vec or nil if the path is not resolvable.")
